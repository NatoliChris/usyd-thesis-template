# Thesis Template

This is a template / example for the University of Sydney PhD Thesis submission.

We currently will comply with the 2020 Submission policy listed [ https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/prepare-thesis.html ](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/prepare-thesis.html).


## Usage

Make sure you have the ``usydthesis.cls`` in the same folder as your thesis, you can pretty much copy from the example.
We provide a number of options with this documentclass, so it should be helpful!

The most basic usage is:

```tex
\documentclass{usydthesis}
```

The options are:

* **ispdf** : ``\documentclass[ispdf]{usydthesis}`` - used for rendering PDFs, removes the book offset indentations for printing.
* **titlecap**: ``\documentclass[titlecap]{usydthesis}`` - used for having the main title capitalised.


### Preamble

We left a LOT of options to be added in the preamble, please modify to suite!

### TL;DR

Use the example, should be good! :)
